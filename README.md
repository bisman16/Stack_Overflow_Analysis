Analysis of Stack Overflow annual developer survey

This analysis is based on Stack Overflow's 2019 annual developer survey taken by 90,000 respondents from 170+ countries. This data is interesting as it gives insights into the background, technology prefernce, satisfaction, salary range, etc. of developers across the world. I'll be using CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) approach to find data-driven solutions to problems faced by individuals and businesses. This is the most popular approach used in the industry and consists of 6 steps:

1.	Business Understanding
2.	Data Understanding
3.	Data Preparation
4.	Data Modelling
5.	Evaluating the results
6.	Deploy

An aspiring developer or engineer who is looking to break into the field is confused as what to do, which technology to learn, etc. It’s always a hassle to prioritize the things to learn because of a plethora of information out there. I believe the best way to get insights is to hear directly from people in the industry. I'll cover answers to the following questions in my analysis -

1. Should I pursue higher education? Which degree – BS, MS..?
2. What should I concentrate in? Subjects?
3. What languages, databases and platforms should I learn?
4. How does the job and career satisfaction look like?
5. How much will I get paid and which countries pay well to software engineers?
6. On what factors does salary depend?
7. On what factors does job/career satisfaction depend?
